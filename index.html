      <h1 style="color:SeaGreen; font-family: 'Lucida Console'; font-size: 40px;"> UIUX Portfolio </h1>
      <p class=title> Welcome to my portfolio! I am an undergraduate from Brown University graduating
        with a Bachelors of Art in Computers Science and a Bachelors of Art in Visual Art.
        The following portfolio focuses on four projects I have worked on this Fall to sharpen my UIUX skills.

      <p class=blurb>
      Undergoing research, conducting interviews, creating a persona, and storyboarding is just scratching the surface
      in order to better understand your consumer and their needs! This project dives into the needs of a golfer
      when they purchase balls at a driving range and how I can improve their experience.

      <img src="papyrus.png">

      <p class=blurb>
      A common UIUX task is to redesign an existing interface which is exactly what I did for this academic
      website outlining the production of papyrus. My goal was to keep the design simple yet aesthetically
      pleasing and modern.

      <h2 style="color:SeaGreen; font-family: 'Lucida Console';""> Imagining a Future </h2>
      <img src="hedgehog.png">
      <p class=blurb>
      After choosing a start-up we were passionate about, I worked in a group to imagine their future
      needs once operation starts. We iterated through multiple designs of an app for mushroom farmers
      using lo-fi Balsamiq and hi-fi Figma applications.

      <img src="bakery.png">
      <p class=blurb>
      In a digital world with increasing digital interactions, I wanted to explore how React makes
      website design more interactive. Here I created a retail website for a hypotheical bakery in which
      customers can sort and filter items as well as add them to their cart!
